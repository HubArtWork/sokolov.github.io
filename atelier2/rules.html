				<div class="benefits-block">
					<h3 class="about-title">Art Subscription Service</h3>
					<p>As a Club Member you have a unique access to our Club Collection and can enjoy great art in the comfort of your own home. We will pre-select a piece from the Club Collection and deliver it straight to your door. After one month, the Artwork will be collected and a new work delivered. While each rental period is subject to a separate Club Collection Hire Agreement, we work hard to ensure that the exchange experience is as convenient and seamless as possible.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="benefits-block">
					<h3 class="about-title">Other Club Services</h3>
					<p>We believe in the power of the collective and are building a Club where everyone can engage with the process and the collection and get the best art experience possible. Alongside with the art subscription service, you will also get</p>
					<ul>
						<li>• Access to the Atelier Club Community (through an online communication platform that facilitates chats, discussions, voting for new art acquisitions etc.) • A Member’s Discount on Food & Beverage in the Atelier Art Café (to be launched later)</li>
						<li>• A Member’s Discount on art acquisitions made through Atelier Club</li>
						<li>• Exclusive access to educational materials on the artists and Artworks within the Atelier Club Collection</li>
						<li>• Invites to exclusive art events organised by Atelier</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="benefits-block">
					<h3 class="about-title">Art Delivery & Collection</h3>
					<p>We will send you a text message a couple days prior to your due First Delivery or Exchange date. We will collect the previous work and deliver a new work for you.</p>
					<p>You will be encouraged to check the condition of the delivered work against its Condition Report. The same way, a Club’s representative will check the collected Artwork against its Condition Report and will take photos of the Artwork (front and back). If any damage occurs, notes will be added to the Condition Report and detailed photographs of the damage will be taken.</p>
					<p>At the Exchange, you will be asked to sign two forms. One for the collected work, confirming that the updated Condition Report is correct and that you have handed the work over to the Club. And the second one for the delivered work, confirming that you accepted it into your possession and that the work’s condition matches the Condition Report.</p>
					<p>Club Members are not liable for the costs of collecting the Artwork on the agreed Collection Date. Club Members must notify Atelier no less than 1 day prior to the Collection Date if they have to change the arranged collection timeslot or date. Should the Club Member fail to notify Atelier, Atelier reserves the right to charge an Additional Collection Fee for collecting the Artwork on an alternative Collection Date.</p>
					<p>If no damage occurred during the rental period, the exchange shouldn’t take more than a couple minutes.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="benefits-block">

					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="benefits-block">
					<h3 class="about-title">Application & Onboarding Process</h3>
					<p>By clicking the button “Apply Now” on the Club’s website you will be redirected to the application form. It will take you no more than a couple minutes to complete it. </p>
					<p>Once we receive your application, we will use the details you provide to conduct identity verification checks, including a credit check with a licensed credit reference agency, in accordance with applicable law and regulations. We will also consider whether your candidature is a good fit for the Club. The approval process may take up to 3 days. </p>
					<p>When we approve your application, you will receive an email confirmation with
						<br>
						1. a link to electronically sign the Club Membership Terms & Conditions and Club Collection Rental Terms. <br>
						2. a link to pay your joining fee and set up your direct debit for monthly membership fees. 
					</p>
					<p>You can set up your payment day to any day of the month that suits you. Your art delivery schedule will be adjusted accordingly.</p>
					<p>Once we have received your joining fee and confirmation of your direct debit, we will send you a link to book a suitable time slot for your first art delivery. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="benefits-block">
					<h3 class="about-title">Membership Fees</h3>
					<p>For legal purposes, your Membership Fee is composed of two parts: Membership and Art Rental Fee. Technically, you can opt out from the art rental agreement and continue being a member of the Club. However, art subscription service is the core value that the Club provides and we expect all our members to use it. If you want to become a member without access to the collection, please email us. </p>
					<p>Club Members must also pay a one-off Joining Fee at the start of their Membership to cover the onboarding costs. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="benefits-block">
					<h3 class="about-title">Cancellation Policy</h3>
					<p>A Club Member may cancel their Membership within 14 days of the Effective Date (the ‘cooling-off’ period) and receive a full refund of the Joining Fee and Membership Fee, while the Art Rental part of the Membership fee will be refined prorated. </p>
					<p>A Club Member or Atelier may end (or ‘terminate’) a Club Member’s Membership at any time and for any reason by giving the other notice in writing. Such notice shall be deemed to take effect on the 1st day of the month two months following the date of the notice, that is:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Notice received on, say, 1st of March will result in termination of Membership with effect from 1st May;</li>
						<li>Notice received on, say, any date from the 2nd through to the 31st March will also result in termination of Membership with effect from 1st May;</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="benefits-block">
					<h3 class="about-title">Member’s Responsibility </h3>
					<p>The Club Member must take adequate and proper measures to protect the Artwork at all times during the Rental Period from theft, damage and/or other risks and in accordance with the Atelier Art Enjoyment & Conservation Guide.</p>
					<p>1.2.   	The Club Member must at all times during the Rental Period keep the Artwork in their possession and control, located at the address specified in the application form. For the avoidance of doubt, Club Members may not relocate the Artwork to another address, unless Atelier have given their express written consent </p>
					<p>In the event a Club Member wishes to change the Specified Address, the Club Member must give Atelier no less than 7 days’ notice. To minimise the risk of damage during relocation, Atelier will collect the Artwork from the Specified Address and deliver it to the new address. </p>
					<p>The Club Member must notify Atelier as soon as they become aware of any defect(s) in or damage to the Artwork. </p>
					<p>The Club Member must provide all reasonable cooperation and assistance to Atelier in connection with the collection of the Artwork at the end of the Rental Period and/or early termination of the Club Collection Hire Agreement.</p>
					<p>The Club Member must not sell, rent, assign, mortgage, pledge, charge, dispose of, grant any interest in, or otherwise encumber, Atelier’s title, ownership, interest and/or ability to repossess the Artwork. The Club Member must not give anyone other than Atelier any legal rights over the Artwork.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="benefits-block">
					<h3 class="about-title">Insurance</h3>
					<p>All works in the Club’s collection are insured, but in case of damage or loss the member partially covers the costs of restoration or replacement, according to the following 2-tier Fixed Rate System. The amount payable by the member depends on the value of a particular artwork:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Up to £500.00 for pieces with an asset value of up to £3,500.</li>
						<li>Up to £750.00 where asset value is £3,500 - £7,000.</li>
						<li>Any excess is covered by the Club.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>If you want to protect yourself from any potential expenses related to damage to the Club’s art, please make sure your home insurance covers art. If it doesn’t, you can call your insurance provider and add art to your policy.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="benefits-block">
					<h3 class="about-title">Club Collection</h3>
					<p>We want to keep an element of surprise so you will not know in advance which particular artwork from the Club Collection you will receive on each delivery. However, as a member, you will have access to our Club’s portal with full details about the Club Collection. You will also have access to our community channel where you will be able to participate in acquisition decisions, suggest artists, give your feedback and discuss the artworks in the Collection.  </p>
					<p>The value of each work in the Club Collection is between £2,000 and £7,000. In exceptional cases, we may acquire more expensives works. This, however, will not affect your membership fees. </p>
					<p>We are also planning to launch a Premium Membership with works ranging in value between £7,000 and £20,000. So if you wish to enjoy more expensive works, you will be able to upgrade your membership. </p>
					<p>Every piece of art in the Collection is re-appraised every 3 years and an Annual Appreciation Index (at the current UK inflation rate) applies. 	</p>
